A lightweight, standalone tool built with **HTML, CSS, and jQuery** to automate the creation of address labels from CSV files.

## 📌 Project Overview
For a publishing company, this tool replaced a repetitive manual process where staff had to re-enter address data. The system:

- Lets users **upload CSV files** with address information  
- Provides a **summary view** of uploaded data  
- Generates **print-ready labels** formatted for Avery sheets  

The application runs entirely **offline** in the browser — no internet connection, server setup, or third-party software required.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **CSV Upload & Parsing**: Import address data with ease  
- **Data Summary**: Review before generating labels  
- **Avery-Compatible Output**: Labels formatted for common sheet layouts  
- **Offline Use**: Just open the HTML file in any modern browser  
- **Minimal Setup**: No installs, no dependencies beyond jQuery
